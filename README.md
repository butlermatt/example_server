# example_server

This is a very basic example of a REST server, to be used in a tutorial
for writing DSA DSLinks. (Link to tutorial to follow). While the example,
and tutorial for the DSLink, are written using [Dart](https://dartlang.org),
it is beyond the scope of this demo and the tutorial to teach the
[Dart Programming language](https://dartlang.org/guides/language/language-tour).

## Installation

Clone the project with:

```
git clone https://github.com/butlermatt/example_server.git
```

From there, change into the directory and run:

```
pub get
```

_(Note: the pubspec.lock has been provided to keep packages on the same version
as when developed.)_
